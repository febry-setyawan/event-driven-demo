# Release Notes

## v1.4.3 - Choreography-Based Saga Pattern (Current)

**Release Date:** 2025-10-19

### Major Changes
- **Saga Pattern Architecture**: Migrated from orchestration to choreography-based saga
  - Order Service no longer auto-calls Payment Service
  - Payment API must be called externally by client
  - Pure event-driven communication between services
  - Decoupled services with no direct HTTP dependencies

### Order Status Flow
1. **Order Created**: Status **WAITING** (waiting for payment)
2. **Payment Success**: Status **COMPLETED** (payment processed)
3. **Payment Failed**: Status **FAILED** (validation or processing error)
4. **No Payment (60s)**: Status **FAILED**, Saga **NO_PAYMENT**
5. **Cancel Payment**: Status **REFUNDED** (payment cancelled)

### New Features
- **Payment Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s)
  - Retries on database save errors
  - Publishes PaymentFailed event after 3 failed attempts
  - Detailed logging for each retry attempt

- **Payment Validation**:
  - Reject payments with amount < 10 (business rule)
  - Simulate retry failure for amount = 999.99 (testing)
  - Publishes PaymentFailed event on validation failure

- **Event-Driven Updates**:
  - PaymentProcessed event → Order COMPLETED
  - PaymentFailed event → Order FAILED
  - PaymentCancelled event → Order REFUNDED

### Technical Changes
- **SagaOrchestrator**: Removed processPaymentStep, added failSaga/refundPayment methods
- **OrderService**: Order status WAITING on creation, added payment event handlers
- **PaymentService**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- **SagaState**: Timeout increased from 30s to 60s
- **Saga Timeout**: Only applies to WAITING status, completed/failed sagas not affected

### Testing Results
All 6 scenarios tested and verified:
- ✅ Order WAITING (no payment yet)
- ✅ Payment Success → COMPLETED
- ✅ Payment Failed (amount < 10) → FAILED
- ✅ No Payment Timeout (60s) → FAILED/NO_PAYMENT
- ✅ Cancel Payment → REFUNDED
- ✅ Retry 3x Failed → FAILED (with detailed logs)

### Database Status Example
```
Order 1: WAITING    | Saga: NO_PAYMENT  (timeout after 60s)
Order 2: COMPLETED  | Saga: COMPLETED   (payment success)
Order 3: FAILED     | Saga: FAILED      (payment validation)
Order 4: REFUNDED   | Saga: REFUNDED    (cancel payment)
Order 5: FAILED     | Saga: FAILED      (retry 3x failed)
```

### Migration Notes
- Payment Service must be called explicitly by client
- Order creation returns orderId immediately with PENDING status
- Check order status via GET /api/orders/{id} for actual status (WAITING)
- Saga timeout increased to 60 seconds for payment processing
- Order and saga status now fully consistent

### Removed
- Auto-call to Payment Service from SagaOrchestrator
- Saga recovery on restart (@PostConstruct)
- Circuit breaker fallback for payment calls
- Orchestration logic from Order Service

  - Updated Grafana Agent to scrape order-gateway instead of deprecated api-gateway
  - Metrics exported from order-gateway and order-service

- **Dashboard Query Aggregation**: Removed duplicate metrics
  - HTTP Response Time: 3 services instead of 9 lines
  - JVM Memory Usage: 3 services instead of 9 lines
  - Aggregated queries by application label using sum() by (application)
  - Changed JVM memory query to use committed_bytes instead of max_bytes

- **Saga Pattern Failures**: Sagas now complete successfully
  - Removed foreign key constraint on payments.order_id
  - Added 1-minute grace period in saga recovery
  - Recovery only compensates sagas older than 1 minute
  - Payment-service now operates independently

- **Circuit Breaker Actuator**: Circuit breaker state now visible
  - Enabled circuitbreakers and circuitbreakerevents actuator endpoints
  - State shows CLOSED for orderService and paymentService

- **Test Suite**: 100% pass rate (43/43 tests)

## v1.4.1 - Swagger UI Order Endpoint Fix

**Release Date:** 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Swagger UI POST /api/orders Endpoint**: Fixed NullPointerException and orderId response
  - Implemented order-response Kafka topic for orderId communication
  - Added correlationId-based request-response pattern
  - Order-gateway now waits for orderId from order-service before returning response
  - Fixed payment service URL paths in order-service configuration

### Implementation
- **New Kafka Topic**: order-response (1 partition, 1 hour retention)
- **OrderValidationFilter**: Kafka consumer to receive orderId from order-service
- **CorrelationId Pattern**: UUID-based correlation for async request-response
- **Order Creation Flow**:
  1. Order-gateway publishes OrderCreated event with correlationId
  2. Order-service persists order and publishes response with orderId
  3. Order-gateway consumes response and returns orderId to client
  4. Synchronous API behavior with async messaging underneath

### Technical Changes
- Added order-response topic with 1 partition
- Timeout: 5-second wait for order-service response
- Fallback: Returns orderId=null if timeout occurs
- Configuration: PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL environment variable for order-service

  - Automatic failure detection and circuit opening
  - Graceful degradation with fallback responses
  - Self-healing with automatic half-open state transition
  - Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts

### Implementation
- **API Gateway**: Circuit breaker for calls to Order Service and Payment Service using Resilience4j Reactor
