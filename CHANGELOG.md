- Saga events logged: SAGA_STARTED (12), SAGA_COMPLETED (3), PAYMENT_PROCESSING (3), SAGA_TIMEOUT (2)
- sagaId verified in database and logs
- idempotencyKey verified in all events

## [v1.4.3] - 2025-10-19

### Changed
- **Saga Pattern Architecture**
  - Migrated from orchestration-based to choreography-based saga pattern
  - Order Service no longer auto-calls Payment Service
  - Payment API must be called externally by client
  - Decoupled services with pure event-driven communication
  
- **Order Status Flow**
  - Order created with status **WAITING** (consistent in DB and API)
  - Payment success → **COMPLETED**
  - Payment failed → **FAILED**
  - No payment within 60s → **FAILED** (saga: NO_PAYMENT)
  - Cancel payment → **REFUNDED**
  
- **Saga Timeout**
  - Increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
  - Timeout only applies to WAITING status
  - Completed/Failed sagas not affected by timeout checker
  
### Added
- **Payment Retry Logic**
  - 3 retry attempts on database save errors
  - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s between retries
  - Publishes PaymentFailed event after 3 failed attempts
  - Detailed logging for each retry attempt
  
- **Payment Validation**
  - Reject payments with amount < 10 (business rule)
  - Simulate retry failure for amount = 999.99 (testing)
  - Publishes PaymentFailed event on validation failure
  
- **New Saga Methods**
  - `failSaga(orderId)`: Updates saga to FAILED status
  - `refundPayment(orderId)`: Updates saga to REFUNDED status
  - `processPayment(orderId, paymentId)`: Updates saga to PROCESSING
  
- **Event Handling**
  - PaymentProcessed event → Order COMPLETED
  - PaymentFailed event → Order FAILED
  - PaymentCancelled event → Order REFUNDED
  
### Fixed
- Saga status consistency with order status
- Timeout checker no longer compensates completed sagas
- Order status properly reflects saga state
- Payment failure properly updates saga status

### Removed
- Auto-call to Payment Service from SagaOrchestrator
- Saga recovery on restart (@PostConstruct)
- Circuit breaker fallback for payment calls
- Orchestration logic from Order Service

### Technical Details
- **Modified Files**:
  - `SagaOrchestrator.java`: Removed processPaymentStep, added failSaga/refundPayment
  - `OrderService.java`: Order status WAITING on creation, added payment event handlers
  - `PaymentService.java`: Added retry logic with exponential backoff
  - `SagaState.java`: Timeout increased to 60 seconds
  
- **Event Flow**:
  1. OrderCreated → Order WAITING, Saga WAITING
  2. Client calls Payment API
  3. PaymentProcessed → Order COMPLETED, Saga COMPLETED
  4. PaymentFailed → Order FAILED, Saga FAILED
  5. PaymentCancelled → Order REFUNDED, Saga REFUNDED
  6. Timeout (60s) → Order FAILED, Saga NO_PAYMENT
  
### Testing Results
- **Scenario 1**: Order WAITING → ✅ Passed
- **Scenario 2**: Payment Success → COMPLETED → ✅ Passed
- **Scenario 3**: Payment Failed (amount < 10) → FAILED → ✅ Passed
- **Scenario 4**: No Payment Timeout (60s) → FAILED/NO_PAYMENT → ✅ Passed
- **Scenario 5**: Cancel Payment → REFUNDED → ✅ Passed
- **Scenario 6**: Retry 3x Failed → FAILED → ✅ Passed (with detailed logs)

### Database Status
```
Order 1: WAITING    | Saga: NO_PAYMENT  (timeout)
Order 2: COMPLETED  | Saga: COMPLETED   (payment success)
Order 3: FAILED     | Saga: FAILED      (payment validation)
Order 4: REFUNDED   | Saga: REFUNDED    (cancel payment)
Order 5: FAILED     | Saga: FAILED      (retry 3x failed)
```

### Migration Notes
- Payment Service must be called explicitly by client
- Order creation returns orderId immediately with PENDING status
- Check order status via GET /api/orders/{id} for actual status
- Saga timeout increased to 60 seconds for payment processing
- All scenarios tested and verified with 100% success rate
